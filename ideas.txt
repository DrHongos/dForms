dforms:

multi signature nft!
(RG signatures on my badge)
(People signing a proposal, government solicite, etc)
(Team signs a bail NFT or somethin')

-mechanics:
NFT tokenURI points to a DDB (or ipns?) where signatures are stored, could be verified or not.
not necessary if people sign the answers (and a multicall verifies them)
