Known bugs:
- Range and Datetime components cant create the register from hook form and they mutate an input value.
  Both are set as required cause they require selection and post affirmation on the input field.
- giving a field a name with '..' inside. will break the field into {predots:{postdots:value}}
- replication check in setInterval - test this!
- Structure is diffuse
- Firefox is shitty.. wtf?
- POST error (502) calling a preload node with harcoded v0 attr and a v1 address
- Test rendezvous node.. maybe cutting off the public ones
- Each new deploy will create a new content hash that the ENS resolver should update... (with a tx!)

#TODO

    -create modal that explains descentralization while it waits for it.. only after successful replication should send you to the stats
- improve tools & attributes in form creation
- improve fields naming and visual aids
- Add options to fields in an interactive dynamic way
- mix the formitem component output in creation with edit/delete functionality
- look for more characteristics to be attributes in a field

- See form creation in smartphone perspective
