Known bugs:
- Range and Datetime components cant create the register from hook form and they mutate an input value.
  Both are set as required cause they require selection and post affirmation on the input field.
- giving a field a name with '..' inside. will break the field into {predots:{postdots:value}}
- replication check in setInterval - test this!
- Structure is diffuse
- Firefox is shitty.. wtf?
- POST error (502) calling a preload node with harcoded v0 attr and a v1 address
- Test rendezvous node.. maybe cutting off the public ones

#TODO
#####################

- copy address function should notify
- support this form should notify
- add alert of public data in form
- add alert for replication post send the form (replication status in stats (own response))
  -create modal that explains descentralization while it waits for it.. only after successful replication should send you to the stats 
- Add options to fields in an interactive dynamic way
- mix the formitem component output in creation with edit/delete functionality
- improve fields naming and visual aids
- improve attributes in form creation
- look for more characteristics to be attributes in a field
- See form creation in smartphone perspective
